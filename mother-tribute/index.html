    <p>In Loving Memory of Le Thi Cam Van</p>

    <h2>About Her</h2>
    <p>Born in 1940 in the coastal city of Nha Trang, Vietnam, my mother was the first child in a family of seven. Her early life was marked by hardship—her father, a political prisoner under French colonial rule, suffered severe mental illness from torture and passed away while she was still young. With strength beyond her years, she helped her mother raise her siblings, putting her own education aside after middle school.</p>
        <p>Even amid adversity, she found purpose and belonging in a Buddhist youth group called Gia Đình Phật Tử ("The Family of Buddhist"), where she remained a devoted member until illness made it impossible in her later years.</p>
        
        <p>She married at the age of 30 to my father, a soldier in the South Vietnamese army. Together, they had four sons—each one bringing him immense joy. But when the war ended and the North took over, our lives changed. My father was imprisoned for four years, and during that time, she carried the heavy responsibility of caring not only for her own children but also for both sides of the extended family.</p>
        
        <p>Despite the hardships, she never wavered. After my father’s return, life remained difficult, but she held our family together. Ten years after my birth, she gave birth to my youngest sister. Overwhelmed by fears for her daughter’s future in a world that had already brought her so much suffering, she wept—believing girls carried heavier burdens. But time would show her that her daughter, like her, would be a source of strength.</p>
        
        <p>She witnessed her sons risk their lives as boatmen escaping Vietnam, endured the anxiety of their absence, and rejoiced at their return. One by one, she ensured her children received education—something she had sacrificed for herself.</p>
        
        <p>In her final years, she cared lovingly for her youngest daughter until, around age 70, she began to suffer from a mysterious illness that gradually took her memories. In time, she became childlike, eventually bedridden for two years before passing away at 78.</p>
        
        <p>Her life was one of sacrifice, devotion, and unyielding love. This tribute is a humble attempt to honor her memory and pass on her story to future generations.</p>

    <h2>Stories and Memories</h2>
    <article>
        <h3>My First Memory of Her</h3>
    <p>My very first memory of my mother is one that has never faded, even though I must have been no older than three. It was late at night — the kind of quiet only found in sleeping households. Everyone else was asleep, but I was burning with a fever. She sat beside me, awake through the night, gently pressing a cool, damp towel to my forehead.</p>
    <p>Even in that early haze of childhood, I remember her face so clearly. It was full of concern — tired, but utterly focused on me. Her hands moved with such care, as if willing the fever to leave me. I didn’t understand sickness or sacrifice then, but I understood love. I saw it in her eyes. I felt it in every cool touch.</p>
    <p>That moment, small as it may seem, stayed with me. It was the first time I knew I was safe — not because I was strong, but because someone stronger was watching over me.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h3>The First Time I Saw Her Angry</h3>
    <P>I must have been two or three years old — still too young to understand much about the world. That day, I saw a side of my mother I had never seen before. She had been out at the market, selling clothes, when something happened at home that called her back in a hurry.</P>
    <P>My older brothers had been playing with matches. They accidentally set part of the bed sheet on fire, burning a large hole and nearly starting a real disaster.</P>
    <P>When my mother arrived, her face was filled with fear and anger. She shouted — not out of cruelty, but out of panic and shock. It was the first time I ever saw her raise her voice. I didn’t understand what we had done wrong, but I remember feeling her emotion. She was overwhelmed.</P>
    <P>She sent us all out of the house shout "Go away, all of you! and don't come back!". I remember my eldest brother carrying me on his back, crying quietly. The other two walked beside us, strangely calm. We circled the block three times before our grandmother came out to call us back in.</P>
    <p>Even at that young age, I knew something serious had happened. That memory stayed with me — not because she was angry, but because it was one of the first times I saw that her love also came with fear, with deep responsibility, with the weight of trying to protect us from things we didn’t yet understand.</p>

        <h3>The Train to Visit Father</h3>
        <p>One of the clearest memories I hold is of a journey we made to visit my father while he was held in a re-education camp, a war prisoner after the fall of South Vietnam. I was just a small child then, and although the circumstances were grim, I remember the excitement that filled us as we prepared for the trip.</p>
        <p>We were going to ride a train — something rare and wondrous to us children. My mother had stayed up the night before, preparing a simple treat for the road: white rice, pressed tightly into a round can, flavored only with pepper and salt. To us, it was special.</p>
        <p>The train left at night. At first, we were lively, buzzing with excitement about the ride and the food. But as the train rumbled on, we began to quiet down. One by one, we laid ourselves down on the wooden floor of the carriage, four small bodies side by side, lulled by the motion of the train.</p>
        <p>My mother, though, didn’t sleep. With no seats, and the floor crowded with passengers, she stayed awake the whole night, watching over us, gently shielding us so that no one would accidentally step on her sleeping children.</p>
        <p>It was not a comfortable journey, nor a safe one, but she made that trip many times during those four years — always with the same quiet strength, the same unwavering dedication to keeping our family connected.</p>
        <p>I didn’t understand the depth of her sacrifice then. But now, I see it for what it was: love in its most enduring form.</p>

        <h3>Bicycle Ride to Visit Grandparents</h3>
        <p>There’s a memory that always stirs in me whenever I see someone riding a bicycle. It takes me back to the years when my father was in a re-education camp, and we lived with our maternal grandmother. Despite the weight of the world on her shoulders, my mother remained committed to keeping family bonds alive — especially the connection to our paternal grandparents.</p>
        <p>
            Every week, like a ritual, we would travel to visit them. It was a journey of about four miles each way. The road started off firm and paved, but as we neared the countryside — where our grandparents lived among the rice fields — the path turned into deep sand, making the ride far more difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet, my mother made that trip every single time. Not alone, but with all four of her young sons in tow — two packed on the bicycle’s front, and two on the back seat. It wasn't just a balancing act, it was a test of patience and strength. Children don’t always sit still — and we were no exception. Sometimes, the boys in the front would bicker and elbow each other. Other times, the two in the back would start their own fight. And on rare days, both ends of the bike would be in chaos at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Back then, I was too young to consider how hard it must have been for her — to push forward through sand, through heat, through noise and quarrels — never once letting us see her break. Now that I’m older, I look back and still ask myself: how did she do it? Not once or twice, but week after week, year after year?
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't have the exact answer to that question. But perhaps it lies in her love, silent and unwavering, that carried us through a life where even a simple bike ride became a symbol of sacrifice and strength.

        <h3>The First Time She Beat Me</h3>
        <p>I was about eight years old when it happened — the first time my mother ever laid a hand on me. I don’t remember exactly what led me to run away from home that day. Maybe it was some childish defiance, or perhaps a misunderstanding I didn’t know how to express. What I do remember, vividly, is what happened when I was brought back.</p>
        <p>As soon as I stepped through the door, she grabbed the nearest thing — a broom — and began hitting me. Each strike came with the frantic words: <em>“Don’t you dare run away again!”</em> Her voice trembled. I was showered in the rain of pain but was caught by supprise when I realized I was not the only one who was crying. In a glimse, I saw it — tears falling down her face as she beat me.</p>
        <p>I didn't get it then, but when I had children of my own, I came to realize that wasn’t punishment born from rage. It was love in its rawest form — messy, terrified, and deeply human. She wasn't trying to hurt me; she was trying to make sure she never had to feel the terror of losing me again.</p>

        <h3>A foolish stunt</h3>
        <p>I was around nine years old when my brother and I pulled one of our most foolish stunts. It was noon, and we had climbed onto a neighbor’s roof to steal some tempting fruit growing just out of reach. After our mischievous feast, I felt the urgent need to "go big" — and without much thought, I relieved myself right there from the rooftop, unaware that fate was about to play a cruel joke.</p>
        <p>Just as the last bit dropped to the ground, the neighbor and his son-in-law walked in — and looked up.

            What followed was a storm of shouting, cursing, and a wild attempt by the son-in-law to climb onto the roof and catch us. But he underestimated the agility of kids who'd spent their childhood scaling walls and playing on rooftops. We leapt from house to house, giggling and panting, until we disappeared from view, leaving the man stunned and helpless behind us.</p>
        <p>The man came to our house, fuming, and told our mother the whole story, expecting her to punish us. Hidden inside, we waited, bracing for her wrath.</p>
        <p>Instead, she turned to him, calm and firm, and asked him sharply, “What were you thinking? Chasing children across rooftops like that? What if one of them had fallen and broken their neck?” Her voice wasn’t apologetic — it was protective and fierce. The man, caught off guard, mumbled something and retreated in embarrassment.

            Of course, we didn’t get off completely free — a spanking surely followed. But I don’t remember the pain.</p>
            <p>What I remember is the moment I realized my mother would stand between us and the world, even when we were wrong. She was our protector — fearless, smart, and always putting our safety first, even in the face of our foolishness.</p>

    <article>
        <h3>A Moment of Pride</h3>
        <p>One of the memories that still warms my heart is something she said so casually, yet it left a lasting imprint on me. We were sitting with a relative, just talking, and she mentioned me — not with scolding or worry, but with a soft smile.</p>
        <p>She said, "<em>He always made me laugh with his silly stories. Even in my darkest days, just listening to him talk nonsense would lift my mood.</em>"</p>
        <p>I was too young to understand the weight of those words then. But looking back, I realize how much it meant — to be her light in a time of shadow, to offer her laughter when life was offering her very little else. That moment made me feel proud of who I was to her. I wasn’t just her child — I was her joy, her laughter, her moment of relief.</p>

    <p>Among all the melodies that filled our home, there was one song that lingered in her heart the most — "Giọt Mưa Thu" ("Autumn Rain Drop"). Originally titled "Vạn Cổ Sầu" ("The Sorrow of Ten Thousand Years"), this haunting composition by Đặng Thế Phong was written as the composer lay on his deathbed, filled with longing and a sense of finality.</p>
    <p>The song speaks of loss, separation, and the quiet ache of yearning — themes that echoed deeply through my mother’s life. To me, it wasn't just her favorite song; it was a reflection of her soul. Through all her struggles — loss, sacrifice, endurance — there remained in her something gentle and poetic, like the autumn rain in the song: steady, sorrowful, but strangely comforting.</p>
    <p>My mother herself was a beautiful singer. Her voice, soft and haunting, matched the mood of "Giọt Mưa Thu" so naturally that it felt as though the song had been written just for her. Whenever I hear those soft, aching notes, I feel her presence. It reminds me of the strength she carried in silence and the depth of emotion she rarely spoke but always felt.</p>

    <h2>Her Legacy</h2>
    <p>My mother’s legacy is not measured in wealth, awards, or fame — but in the lives she touched and the love she gave unconditionally. Born in Nha Trang in 1940, the first of seven children, she stepped into responsibility early, shaped by hardship and loss. When her own father died young — broken by the traumas of political imprisonment — she became a pillar for her mother and siblings, trading her schoolbooks for duty. From a young age, she carried burdens no child should, and did so without bitterness.</p>
    <p>That quiet strength defined her life.</p>
    <p>She lived through war, political upheaval, and deep personal sacrifice — but she never gave up on family. When my father was imprisoned for four years after the war, she became everything: mother and father, caregiver and provider, protector and nurturer. She ferried four young boys across rice fields on a bicycle just to maintain a bond with our paternal grandparents. She stayed up on crowded train rides to keep us safe. She worked, cooked, worried, taught, scolded, forgave, and loved without reserve.</p>
    <p>She taught us, not through words, but through how she lived:</p>
    <p><em>To be resilient.</em></p>
    <p><em>To protect those we love.</em></p>
    <p><em>To carry each other through hardship.</em></p>
    <p><em>To find meaning in small joys</em> - a simple meal, a safe sleep, a quiet moment.</p>
    <p><em>To stand firm even when the world is unfair.</em></p>
    <p>She was strict when needed, protective always, and deeply human — with laughter, with tears, and with fierce emotion. Even in her discipline, there was love. Even in her worry, there was strength.</p>
    <p>In her final years, as her memories faded, I often wondered what she remembered of us — of all she had done, and all we had become. But I know this: we carry her in our lives, in our choices, in our own children. Her values live on — in our loyalty, in our grit, in our love for one another.</p>
    <p>She may no longer be here in body, but her spirit is woven into the story of our family — the foundation upon which we stand.</p>
    <p>That is her legacy.</p>
